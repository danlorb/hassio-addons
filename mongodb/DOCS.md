# Home Assistant Community Add-on: DynDns Updater

DynDns Updater to update your public IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses in Hetzner DNS Server. It works out-of-the-box with no or minimal configuration. For more information, please see [Hetzner DNS].

## Prerequesites

Before you can start, you need a Hetzner Login, access to [Hetzner DNS] Console and a Hetzner DNS API Token.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Click the Home Assistant My button below to open the add-on on your Home
   Assistant instance.

   [![Open this add-on in your Home Assistant instance.][addon-badge]][addon]

1. Click the "Install" button to install the add-on.
1. Set a `api_token` and configure your Domains which should updated
1. Start the "DynDns" add-on.
1. Check the logs of "DynDns" to see if everything went well.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
api_token:
records:
  - domain: my-domain.com
    name: www
    ttl: 3600
    ipv4: true
    ipv6: true
  - domain: my-domain.com
    name: "*"
    ttl: 3600
interval: 1h
log_level: info
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `api_token`

Hetzner DNS API Token to access Hetzner DNS Server

### Option: `interval`

Interval to look for new Public IP Addresses

### Option: `records`

Collection of DNS Entries to update

### Option: `name`

### Option: `ttl`

**Note**: _TTL should be identical with `interval`_

### Option: `ipv4`

Update only `A` Records

**Note**: _If **ipv4** and **ipv6** not given, both Record Types will updated_

### Option: `ipv6`

Update only `AAAA` Records.

**Note**: _If **ipv4** and **ipv6** not given, both Record Types will updated_

### Option: `my_fritz_fqdn`

Use MyFritz to determine the Public IP Address, otherwise Cloudflare `whoami` Service will used.

**Note**: _This could only work, if you have registered your Fritz Box by AVM_
